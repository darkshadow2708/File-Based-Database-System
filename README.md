# File-Based-Database-System
A simple File Based Datsbase system in which the entries are written in key-value pair form and reading/writing is done from/to the file using binary search to make the implementation faster using Golang.
Here I started with the empty file and key-value pair will be provided by the user and it is being written in the file using Binary Search.
Similarly,if user want to read from the file ,he just need to pass the key to it and it will give the value corresponding to it.
If user want to update the value corresponding to key then he can do this too by just again writing the key-value.
These all's are implemented in Golang using the os package of golang by basic read and write file operations.
